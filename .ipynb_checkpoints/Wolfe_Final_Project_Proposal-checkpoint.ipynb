    "I am interested in learning about why hesitancy around the COVID-19 vaccine has persisted in the United States. Upon my initial research, I found survey data from the United States Census Bureau which asks respondents if they have received a COVID-19 vaccine and if not, why they are hesitant to do so. In the survey, I noticed that social factors were not included in the given reasons for vaccine hesitancy. While many of their statements could possibly be related to social influence, none of the reasons given in the survey specifically point to social influences. While it’s impossible to know what specific social influences are present in the lives of the survey respondents due to the survey’s anonymity, it’s reasonable to suspect that their geographic location has an influence on them. So, for my final project, I will analyze the relationship that exists between the respondents’ vaccination status and the number of vaccinations per 100,000 residents in their state."

I also intend on producing visualizations of the data in terms of traditional scatter graphs and potentially map representations.\n"

For the statistical modeling aspect of the project, I think that I need to be more realistic because I think I will struggle a lot with the specification and inference of my models. I think that a reasonable expectation is that my inference should make sense for the specifications of my models even if there was a better way that the models could have been constructed."
